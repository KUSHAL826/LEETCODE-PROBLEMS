# LEETCODE-PROBLEMS

I am currently a 3rd-semester Computer Science student, actively building my foundation in programming and problem-solving. Since mid-November, I have been consistently solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode using the C programming language. My goal is to strengthen core concepts such as arrays, pointers, recursion, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming while improving logic-building skills. This repository tracks my daily learning progress as I work through problems from scratch, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code. Along the way, I aim to develop strong problem-solving habits, understand multiple solution approaches, and gradually tackle more challenging questions. This journey is part of my preparation for future internships, technical interviews, and becoming industry-ready with solid fundamentals.
